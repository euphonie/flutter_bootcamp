## Io ho un cane lupo 
# I have a dog

Simple application to test some features of Flutter: 

- MaterialApp
- AppBar with color styling
- Container with padding
- Centered content
- CircleAvatar 
- AssetImage with local file

Takeaways: 
- Widgets that have static content should be declared using `const` as they will not change over time.
- Image assets can be defined from folder level instead of individually
